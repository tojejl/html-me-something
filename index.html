            <p>Companion Planting is a technique to create a healthy and thriving garden. Planting compatible vegetables and flowers near each other promotes a healthy ecosystem along with building natural defense against pests and other destructive elements. Why use companion planting when there are many sprays and chemicals to treat for pests. The deminised use of mass-produced pesticides is not only beneficial for the earth but also for you. </p>

                <p>My Great Grandparents were tomato farmers here in St. Louis. Looking back on that personal history I have found growing tomatoes to be a connection to family history. I have grown tomatoes in my garden for the past several years. Tomato plants require generious watering for a thriving plant thoughout the growing season. Cageing or staking you plants early on prevents damging the roots system later.There are two varieties of Tomatoes: detriminate and indetriminate. Prune indetriminate tomatoe varieties, they will grow without abandon. Prune using clean pruning shears and focusing on removing the "suckers" these are stems that grow between the branch and main stem.  
                Conpantion planting for tomatoes include the following plants.
                <ul>
                    <li>Basil</li>
                    <li>Marigolds</li>
                    <li>Asparagus</li>
                    <li>Parsley</li>
                    <li>Spinach</li>
                    <li>Carrots</li>
                </ul> 
                Tomatoes do not play well with the following plants:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cabbage</li>
                    <li>Beets</li>
                    <li>Peas</li>
                    <li>Fennel</li>
                    <li>Dill</li>
                    <li>Rosemary</li>
                </ul>

    <p>Peppers are by far one of the more finicky plants in the garden. I have tried growing the whole gammut of peppers, bell peppers, mini spicy pepers, and sweet peppers with moderate success. Warmer temperatures means the pepper plant will require consistent watering. Make sure to water at the base of the plant and not the leaves. Watering the leaves could result in rot. Pepper plants require full sun for the fruits to develop. When transfering plants grown from seed prepare the soil with fertilzer. The soild should be moist and well draining and rich in organinic matter. 
    <ul>
        <li>Basil</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Spinach</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    Peppers and beans should not be planted near each other to prevent the vines from the beans from spreading.

    <h2>Lettuce</h2>

    <p> I look forward to the first lettuces harvest every single summer! Fresh lettuce has a bolder taste compared to what can be purchased in the grocery store. When planting lettuce plants behind a fence keeps rabbits. When choosing a space in the garden make sure the soil is loose which will help with water draining. Lettuces is a cool weather plant, so it grows best in either the spring or the fall. While many lettuces are planted during the summer, too much sunlight can result in a bitter-tasting leaf. Try planting taller plants like tomatoes and corn to shade the lettuces from the sun. 
        Lettuces can be planted with any of the plants below for a better yeild.
         <ul>
            <li>Mint</li>
            <li>Beans</li>
            <li>Beets</li>
            <li>Broccoli</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>Corn</li>
            <li>Radishes</li>
            <li>Marigolds</li>
            <li>Lavender</li>
            </ul>
            Avoid planting lettuce near parsley. Parsley grows as small bushy plants which can crowd lettuce.
